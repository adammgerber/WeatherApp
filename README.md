# WeatherApp 
### <ins>A Very simple weather app with hardcoded data(no API)</ins>
### The purpose of this app is to: 
- understand the SwiftUI View tree structure
- UI properties(importance of order of properties)
- @State and @Bind
- SwiftUI's declarative syntax vs imperative we're all used to :/
